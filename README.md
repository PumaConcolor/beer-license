# The Energy Link License :boom:

## Introduction

Since I don't have a degree in Law I tend to hit "agree" under the kilometric blurbs that come bundled with software, without really understanding what they mean. Even the simplest an clearest license, which for me is the [MIT], took me a while to understand fully: it's true that English is not my native tongue, but why should such complicated terminology be used? Can't we express the same, common meaning with more ease? 

This is frustrating.

Finally, I came across the [SUSHI-WARE](https://github.com/MakeNowJust/sushi-ware) license, itself an alcohol-free spin of the [BEER-WARE](https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/) license: I was struck by the purpose of the license, but... sushi? Beer? Don't get me wrong, I really like Japanese food (I'd rather have udon or tofu though) and I love beer, but while studying or writing software I absolutely need Energy Drink, something more "powerful" than simple coffee [COFFE-WARE](https://github.com/jack23247/espresso-license).

So, under these terms and conditions, the [Energy Drink license](LICENSE) was born.

## Applying

### Notice

This license is as serious as Mr. Stone is (and he's got some serious firepower, trust me). 

Jokes aside. If you'd like to license your project under the Energy Drink license, go ahead: just be advised that it's not a certified [OSI] or [FSF] license. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is suited for large projects, at least not alone: for maximum coverage you can marry this to another (still human readable, but more official) license like the [MIT].
